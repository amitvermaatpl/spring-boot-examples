### Concept of Cache: Reduce number of database hits ###
Caching is a mechanism to enhance the performance of a system. It is a temporary memory that lies between the 
application and the persistent database. Cache memory stores recently used data items in order to reduce the 
number of database hits as much as possible.

Caching of frequently used data in application is a very popular technique to increase performance of application. 
With caching, we store such frequently accessed data in memory to avoid hitting the costly backends every time when 
user requests the data. 

#=# Spring boot cache annotations #=#
1. @EnableCaching: add it to the boot application class annotated with @SpringBootApplication.
2. @Cacheable: It is used on the method level to let spring know that the response of the method are cacheable. 
   @Cacheable ("cache-name1", “cache-name2”).
3. @CachePut: to manipulate the cacheing manually to put (update) cache before method call. 
   @CacheEvict: It is used when we need to evict (remove) the cache previously loaded of master data. 
   When CacheEvict annotated methods will be executed, it will clear the cache. 
4. @Caching: required when we need both CachePut and CacheEvict at the same time.

# DEMO #
Now, test with url GET: http://localhost:8080/student/1

First Time : it will take time and print "sleep for 5 secs...."
Next hit, same url: NO log prints, means return from cache .

Now, hit the url PUT: http://localhost:8080/student/1     [It evicts the cache]
If you gain hit the url GET: http://localhost:8080/student/1  [Again it will take 5sec, bcoz cache cleared by cache evict.]
