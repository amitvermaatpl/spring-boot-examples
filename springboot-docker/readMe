## CONCEPT ##
These standalone executable packages are called docker images. And a running instance of a docker image is 
called a docker container.

DockerFile: The first step is to configure the files required for Docker to build itself an image. Docker Images 
are simply blueprints of environments that you want to create while containers are the actual running and functional
environments.

### Steps to use docker ###
1. Install docker in your machine.
2. Create a spring boot rest api project.

3. Create a file named Dockerfile in the project root directory.
   This is used by Docker while creating the image. It is basically declaring the Java runtime information
   and target distributions.
   
4. Add two maven plugins in the pom.xml file so that we can use the Docker related maven commands while creating
   the instance. Those plugins are dockerfile-maven-plugin and maven-dependency-plugin.
   
5. Create a docker image from dockerfile.
   > Now use maven command mvn clean install dockerfile:build to create docker image.
   
   > In docker quickstart terminal go to project location like-
     cd "C:\Users\IBM_ADMIN\Desktop\my github\springboot-docker-hello\springboot-docker" 
     
   > And then run- mvn clean install dockerfile:build
   
4. Deploy and Run Docker Image.
   So we have created the Docker Image (i.e. hello-docker-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-docker-info.jar). We also have a installed
   docker container running in our local machine.

   Now, to run the docker image inside installed docker container, we will use below command.
   
5. Run the image
   > In Docker Container(QuickStart Terminal) run below command to check your image-
     docker image ls
   > My docker image name is:- springio/hello-docker
   > Run the image in container:-  docker run -p 8090:9080 springio/hello-docker
   
   > URL to test it outside Docker container.: http://192.168.99.100:8090/hello/Amit
     [NOTE: Please check the IP of docker and change it in URL]
   
6. STOP the container
   We can list down all docker containers by command * docker container ps * in the terminal and we can use command
   docker stop <container ID>

7. Publish the image in Docker-Hub

   > Logging with your dockerId
     docker login
     
   > TAG the image: docker tag 'image' username/repository:tag  [repository: project name=springboot-docker]
     docker tag springio/hello-docker amitverma75741/springboot-docker:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
   
   > Check the image using command: docker image ls
   
   > Publish the image in dockerHub[30xx..xxD...]
     docker push amitverma75741/springboot-docker:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
   
   > Pulling the image from docker hub and running it: Just you need docker on your machine.
     docker run -p 8090:9080 amitverma75741/springboot-docker:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
     
     OR
     
     docker run -p 8090:9080 amitverma75741/springboot-docker:0.0.2-SNAPSHOT
     
     The docker run command pulls the image from docker hub if it is not available locally, and then runs it.
     NOTE: Actual port is 9080, but for your local OS it is 8090
